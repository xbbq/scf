Refer to `mapping_publish.ipynb` for reproducing the plots for cell mapping/integration. We saved the results as the adata files, which can be downloaded from figshare. You can directly plot the umap by using these adata files. In other words, the code in the `mapping_publish.ipynb` file is used for producing the results in the figshare: https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24049200.
