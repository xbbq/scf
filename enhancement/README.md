You can check the ipynb files `Baron_evaluation.ipynb`  and `PBMC68k_evaluation.upynb` for reproducing the results shown in the paper. Previouly, the embeddings required for most downstream tasks were obtained from the `run_embedding_sc.py`. We provided the embedding used for training the DeepCDR model in this repository. You can also use the API and model code provided by us to obtain the cell embeddings from scFoundation.
