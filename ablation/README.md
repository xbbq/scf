`ablation-00.ipynb`: We ablated different embedding types including concat, max pooling, mean pooling, and token S. We evaluated the performance on the clustering task and drug sensitivity task.
`ablation-01.ipynb`: We ablated bin strategy and loss settings, and evaluated the performance on the clustering task
`ablation-02.ipynb`: We ablated with/without a downsampling strategy, and evaluated the performance on the enhancement task. This script contains the results of model without downsampling. for the results of model with downsampling (scFoundation), please refer to the `enhancement` downstream tasks.
